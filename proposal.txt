Task 1: Trimming unnecessary lexical elements from text.
Objective: Remove unnecessary parts-of-speech from query like (ADP,CCONJ,DET,PART,SCONJ)

POS Tag	Meaning
ADP	Adposition (prepositions like for, with, etc.)
CCONJ	Coordinating conjunction (like and, but)
DET	Determiner (like the, a, an)
PART	Particle (like to in "to go")
SCONJ	Subordinating conjunction

Approach: A Python-based NLP pipeline that filters e-commerce queries by removing unnecessary words using Spacy POS tagging.




Task2:  Extracting query based on user intent

In e-commerce search queries, customers often mention a primary product along with accessories or secondary items, usually connected by prepositions like "with", "for", "including", etc. The goal is to automatically segment the query into:

    The main product part (primary search intent)

    The accessory or secondary part (additional but non-core items)

Example:

    Input: "show me samsung s24 with charger"

    Output:

        Primary product: "samsung s24"

        Secondary item: "charger"
