Proposal: Hybrid Entity Understanding for Samsung.com Search Queries

Approach: MiniLM NER + Heuristic Proximity Labeling + Transformer-based Main Product Identifier

🎯 Objective

Improve understanding of natural language product search queries (e.g.,
“show me high-end phone with 8GB RAM”) by accurately extracting:

Product entities (phone, tablet, TV, etc.)

Attribute constraints (RAM, storage, camera, etc.)

Qualitative modifiers (high-end, budget, premium)

The primary product of interest (main_pdt)

This enables better query-to-search-filter mapping, improving relevance and conversion.

🧩 Components
1️⃣ MiniLM-Based Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Purpose:
Detect core entities from user queries.

Entities Extracted:

Product types (phone, tablet, tv, laptop)

Attributes (ram, storage, battery, camera)

Attribute values (8GB, 128GB, 5000mAh)

Qualitative tiers (high-end, budget, flagship)

Why MiniLM:

Lightweight, low-latency

Good accuracy for short search queries

Cost-efficient to deploy and fine-tune

Outcome:
Raw entities with spans and confidence scores.

2️⃣ Heuristic Proximity-Based Adjective & Attribute Linking

Purpose:
Attach extracted modifiers and attributes to the correct product entity.

Problem Solved:
Search queries are short and often ungrammatical, making dependency parsing brittle.

Approach:

Attach adjectives (e.g., “high-end”) to nearest product entity within a token window

Attach attribute values (e.g., “8GB”) to nearest compatible attribute (e.g., RAM)

Optionally use lightweight linguistic signals (noun chunks, token distance)

Why Heuristics:

Low computational cost

Highly interpretable

Robust to messy user input

Faster iteration compared to retraining models

Outcome:
Structured product-attribute-modifier groupings.

3️⃣ Transformer-Based Main Product Identifier

Purpose:
Identify the primary product of interest when multiple product entities are present.

Example Queries:

“compare phone and tablet with 8GB RAM”

“best samsung phone and tv deals”

Approach:

Train a small classifier (MiniLM/DistilBERT) to score each detected product entity

Input: full query + candidate product

Output: probability of being the main product

Why This Is Needed:

Dependency tree root is unreliable for short queries

Heuristics alone don’t generalize well to comparison or multi-product queries

Benefits:

More robust than syntactic root heuristics

Low inference cost

Easy to improve with additional labeled data

Outcome:
Single main_pdt decision used to drive search ranking and filtering logic.

⚖️ Why This Hybrid Approach
Aspect	Benefit
Accuracy	ML handles entity detection, heuristics handle noisy structure
Cost	MiniLM + rules + small classifier (no heavy LLM dependency)
Latency	Suitable for real-time search
Maintainability	Heuristics and schema can evolve independently
Scalability	New attributes/products can be added without retraining full system
🧪 Evaluation Strategy

Component-Level Metrics:

NER: Precision / Recall / F1 on entity extraction

Linking: % of correct attribute → product attachment

Main Product: Accuracy in multi-product queries

End-to-End Metrics:

Query → correct filter mapping rate

Impact on search relevance (CTR, conversion uplift – later phase)

🗺️ Phased Delivery Plan
Phase 1 – Foundation

Deploy MiniLM NER

Define entity schema

Baseline extraction accuracy

Phase 2 – Heuristic Linking

Implement proximity-based attachment logic

Add normalization for attribute values

Offline evaluation on real query logs

Phase 3 – Main Product Classifier

Build weakly-labeled dataset

Train MiniLM classifier for main product detection

Integrate into pipeline

Phase 4 – Integration & Optimization

End-to-end pipeline

Confidence thresholds + fallbacks

Monitoring & error analysis

🚀 Expected Impact

Better understanding of natural language queries

More accurate search filtering (RAM, segment, price tier)

Improved relevance for premium/budget intent

Foundation for future personalization and recommendations

🔮 Future Extensions (Optional Roadmap)

Support for comparison intent (“phone vs tablet”)

Price range understanding (“under 50k”)

Personalized ranking using user preferences

Gradual transition to joint slot-filling models if needed
